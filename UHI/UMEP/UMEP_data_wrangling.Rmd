title: "UMEP Data Wrangling"
output: html_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The purpose of this markdown is to wrangle some data downloaded from NOAA to use as an input for the UMEP model. After running UMEP, I'm hoping to generate a SUEWS compatable data set for Austin to test the model.

###Step 1: Loading Packages and Reading in the csvs 
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

```



```{r}
weather_data = read_csv("AustinJuneExampleWeather.csv")
radiation_data = read_csv("AustinJuneExampleData.csv")
```

###Step 2: Finding a way to convert the two different time signatures
One data set uses five minute intervals for the entire 24 hour period of the day. the other dataset uses measurements twice an hour. Both will serve for UMEP, but require somewrangling to match up. 

```{r}

```
